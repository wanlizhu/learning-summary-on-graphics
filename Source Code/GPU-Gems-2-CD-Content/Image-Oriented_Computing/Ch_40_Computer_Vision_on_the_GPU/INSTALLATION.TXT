Installation Instructions:

Basic Installation:

  First, compile VideoOrbits-2.204  (from comparametrics.sf.net), 
  using :  "./configure; make"

  Assuming you have all the packages listed below, type: 
  
  make VO_DIR=<path_of_videoorbits-2.204> CG_DIR=<path_of_SDK>

    where <path_of_videorbits-2.204> is where videorbits-2.204 (or greater is)
    and <path_of_SDK> is the Cg SDK path

  example:
 
    make VO_DIR=~/videorbits-2.204 CG_DIR=~/SDK

  by default, the above options are assumed.  So if you download 
  the Cg SDK to your home directory, and untar videorbits-2.204 from
  your home directory, all you'll have to do is type: 'make'


What you'll need:
    * nvidia drivers

    You likely have already the following, otherwise you'll need to install

    * glut
    * imlib-dev Imlib development libraries
    * libxml-dev
    * libdc1394-dev (and 1394 support (raw1394 or video1394))
    * jpeg-mmx


    You'll likely have to install the following before compiling Openvidia:

    * videorbits (version later or equal to 2.204)
    * Cg Compiler (cgc) (from nvidia.com website)
    * Cg development kit (from nvidia.com website)
    * xnee and libxnee (http://www.gnu.org/software/xnee/)
     
    and (http://www.gnu.org/directory/libs/cpp/commoncpp.html)
    * libcommoncpp2-1.0-0c102 (available as apt package for easier install)
    * libcommoncpp2-dev

A note on shared memory areas: 

  A number of the programs use shared memory areas, which are sometimes 
  incorrectly created.  If you have this problem, try 'make glestpchirp2m'
  then running it first.  It will create the shared memory areas.

Additional Help:
  
   http://openvidia.sf.net has forums to post to and read.
